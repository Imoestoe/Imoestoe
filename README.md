<p style="color:red"> Hi! ðŸ‘‹</p>

My name is mart, I am 16 years old and I study software development in Zwolle.

Since today I started my new portfolio website. 
This is because the backlog list of the small project "Trainpain"or trainapi is coming to an end.
I'm picking up this project with Vuejs and laravel. (for me the first project with vuejs). 
Later I want to replace the backend with Django/Symfony.

Due to problems with my motherboard, I have unfortunately not been able to program properly in recent days. 
I hope I can fix this soon :(
